# Reality Engine

A vector-based state machine system that models reality through observable events and CriticalEventSequence (CES) machines. Inputs are assembled by the **Perception Engine** from configurable sources and pushed into the **Reality Engine**, where registered machines process them through a shared 256-byte perceptual space.

## Service Access URLs

All services are exposed via a TLS-terminating nginx proxy. Start the stack, then open:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Visualizer Frontend** | https://localhost:5173 | Primary web UI (Tobias canvas view, machine administration) |
| **Perception Engine UI** | https://localhost:3005 | Source management and live push controls |
| **Grafana Logs** | https://localhost:3002 | Centralized log dashboard (admin / admin) |
| **Reality Engine API** | https://localhost:3000 | Scala/Akka HTTP core engine |
| **Visualizer Backend** | https://localhost:3001 | WebSocket proxy and REST passthrough |
| **Perception Engine API** | https://localhost:3004 | Source assembly, auto-push, and perceive endpoint |
| **Qdrant Dashboard** | http://localhost:6333/dashboard | Vector database UI |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate dev TLS certificates (first time only)
bash certs/generate-dev-certs.sh

# Start the full universe (localAIStack + Reality Engine + integration verify)
./startUniverse.sh

# Or start fresh (wipe perception sources, rebuild RE images with --no-cache)
./startUniverse.sh --fresh

# Stop all services
./scripts/stop.sh
```

`startUniverse.sh` is the recommended entry point — it brings up Ollama, localAIStack (Qdrant + Redis + API), and all Reality Engine services, then verifies machine/sensor/Qdrant integration.

If localAIStack is already running and you only need to (re)start Reality Engine services, use `./scripts/start.sh` instead.

Browsers will warn about the self-signed certificate — add an exception or use `--ignore-certificate-errors` when running Playwright.

## Architecture

The system runs as nine Docker services connected on a private `reality-network`:

### Data flow

1. **Perception Engine** assembles a 256-element vector from its configured sources (test sequences, simulated signals, or live sensors).
2. It posts the vector to **Visualizer Backend** `/api/perceive`, which forwards it to **Reality Engine** `/api/perceive`.
3. The Reality Engine runs a 3-phase snapshot → process → merge loop over all registered machines, writing machine outputs back into the shared perceptual space.
4. The Visualizer Backend broadcasts `perceptual-simulation-stepped` to all WebSocket clients.
5. The **Visualizer Frontend** receives the broadcast and updates the Tobias canvas and output history.

The perceptual space is **persistent**: machine output regions carry forward unchanged into the next push unless a source explicitly overwrites them. This enables multi-machine feedback loops (e.g. an RS flip-flop whose Q output is observed by downstream machines).

## Core Concepts

### RealityVector

A 1×n element vector representing a state in reality. Each element has a value and a comparator (`gte`, `equals`, `threshold`). Vectors are chained via `nextVectorIds` to form directed state graphs.

### CriticalEventSequence (CES)

A directed graph of RealityVectors. Requires at least one `isInitial` vector (always active) and at least one vector with an `outputVector`. When the terminal vector matches, the machine asserts its output into the perceptual space.

### Machine

A named collection of CriticalEventSequences with a **perceptual mapping** — `inputRegion` and `outputRegion` — that defines which bytes of the 256-element shared perceptual space the machine reads from and writes to.

### Perceptual Space

A 256-byte shared vector. All machines snapshot their input region, process concurrently, then merge their outputs in a single atomic phase. Sources outside a machine's assigned regions are unaffected.

### Perception Engine

Manages **sources** (test sequences, simulated waveforms, live sensors) and assembles them into the next push vector. Supports:
- **Single step** — push one assembled vector manually
- **Auto-push** — push on a configurable timer (default 600 ms)
- **Persistent base** — starts each push from the previous step's full PS so machine outputs survive between pushes

## Visualizer Views

### Tobias (Canvas 2D)
Primary simulation view. Shows all registered machines as force-directed cards with internal CES graphs. Controls:
- **▶ Play / ⏸ Pause** — starts/stops Perception Engine auto-push
- **⏭ Single Step** — pushes one vector immediately
- **↺ Reset** — clears PE step counter and RE simulation state
- **📑 Sequences** — open the input sequence builder panel

### Machine Administration
Full-screen CES graph for a single machine. Connected to the visualizer backend WebSocket; highlights active nodes in real time as steps arrive.

### Machine Interconnection
Graph showing all machines and their perceptual space region overlaps (edges indicate one machine's output region overlaps another's input region).

---

## Machine JSON Files

Machines are defined as JSON files in `examples/machines/`. Load via:

```bash
# Via API
curl -sk https://localhost:3000/api/machines/json/RS2

# Via Tobias → Sequences → (load a machine)
```

Machine JSON format: see `data/rs-flipflop.json` for a complete example.

## Configuration

### Environment (`.env` / docker-compose)

| Variable | Service | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Reality Engine | 3000 | HTTP listen port |
| `VIZ_PORT` | Visualizer Backend | 3001 | HTTP listen port |
| `REALITY_ENGINE_URL` | Visualizer Backend, PE | http://reality-engine:3000 | Internal RE address |
| `PERCEPTION_TARGET_URL` | Perception Engine | http://visualizer-backend:3001 | Where PE pushes vectors |
| `DATA_PATH` | Perception Engine | /app/data | Source persistence directory |

### TLS Proxy

`nginx/tls-proxy.conf` — terminates HTTPS/WSS for all external ports. Dev certificates live in `certs/`. Regenerate with `bash certs/generate-dev-certs.sh`.

---

## E2E Testing

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time)
npx playwright install chromium

# Run all tests against the running stack
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run with headed browser
npx playwright test --headed
```

Tests live in `e2e/tests/`. See `E2E_TESTING.md` for full configuration.

---

## Logging

All containers forward logs to **Loki** via the Docker Loki log driver. View in Grafana at https://localhost:3002.

```logql
# All services
{app="reality-engine"}

# Specific service
{app="reality-engine", service="perception-engine-backend"}

# Errors only
{app="reality-engine"} |~ "(?i)error"
```

See `LOKI_GRAFANA_SETUP.md` for dashboard and alerting configuration.
